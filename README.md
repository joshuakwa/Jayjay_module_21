- Cucumber Integration: Implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber, writing tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin language.
- Java-Based Framework: Leverage the power of Java for creating a flexible and maintainable automation framework.
- Reporting: Generate detailed test reports to analyze the results and track the performance of automated tests.
- Page Object Model (POM): Use the Page Object Model to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication.
